# 2. Diffrence Between Compiler and Interpreter ?
   =>A compiler translates the entire program into machine code at once and then executes it, while an interpreter translates and runs the program line by line.
# 3. Why we are use python for data science?
   =>We use Python for data science because it is easy to learn, has a large number of powerful libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow), supports data handling, visualization, and machine learning, has a huge community, and allows for fast prototyping and integration compared to other languages.
